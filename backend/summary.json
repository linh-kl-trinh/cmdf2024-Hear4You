  "content": "- DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms.\n- The information in DNA is stored as a code made up of four chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T).\n- Human DNA consists of about 3 billion bases, and more than 99 percent of those bases are the same in all people.\n- The order, or sequence, of these bases determines the information available for building and maintaining an organism.\n- DNA bases pair up with each other, A with T and C with G, to form units called base pairs.\n- Nucleotides are arranged in two long strands that form a spiral called a double helix."
