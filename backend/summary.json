  "content": "- Neuroscientists at MIT have discovered a circuit in the brain that controls vocalisation in both humans and mice, ensuring that breathing is prioritised over speaking.\n- The circuit is found in a brainstem region called the pre-B tzinger complex, which regulates the breathing rhythm and stops speech when it is time to breathe in.\n- When the researchers blocked the circuit in mice, they were unable to produce ultrasonic vocalisations (USVs) or any other kind of vocalisation.\n- However, the circuit is flexible and can be overridden, such as when mice produce USVs even when breathing in.\n- The team now plans to study the circuit's role in other functions such as coughing and swallowing."
