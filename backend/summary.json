  "content": "- The Big Bang is a theory that explains the origin and evolution of the universe,\n- Expanding from a extremely hot and dense initial state, it explains a broad range of phenomena such as the abundance of light elements, the CMB, and large-scale structure.\n- While the theory is not without challenge (such as the lack of a widely accepted theory of quantum gravity), empirical evidence strongly favours the Big Bang over competitor theories.\n- As such, it is essentially the universally accepted explanation for the origins of the universe. \n- The age of the universe, derived from analyses of the expansion rate, is estimated to be 13.787\u00b10.020 billion years."
